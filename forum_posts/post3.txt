In recent years, there has been an increasing focus on sustainable energy policies globally. Countries are now investing heavily in renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydropower to reduce their carbon footprints and combat climate change. Major economies are setting ambitious targets to phase out fossil fuels and promote cleaner, greener technologies. However, challenges such as high costs, infrastructure limitations, and political opposition still hinder progress in some areas. The transition to a sustainable energy future requires coordinated efforts from governments, businesses, and individuals to be successful.
